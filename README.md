Here belong some scripts used for analysis of molecular trajectories.


## scripts_contacts_cg_martini3/
Here are python scripts used to compute distance between structures modelled with MARTINI3.
It measure the distance between the two backbone beads and write in a csv file all the distance between all pair through the whole simulation.
